# Demographic-Segmentation-and-Analysis

Demographic Segmentation is the process of division of customer base into 
several groups of individuals that share a similarity in different ways that are 
relevant to marketing such as gender, age, interests, and miscellaneous 
spending habits. 
Specifically, we made use of a 
clustering algorithm called K-means clustering. We analysed and visualized 
the data and then proceeded to implement our algorithm.
